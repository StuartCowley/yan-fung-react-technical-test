# ðŸŒŽ React NASA image search - mock technical test

## Introduction 
A mock technical test as part of the frontend module of [Command Shift](https://www.commandshift.co/).  

I was expected to build a React web application that allows users to search for images based on a query relating to space. The application was built with React and JSX along side with using Jest and React Testing library for testing purpose. Axios is used to perform http requests for retrieving data from the API and PropTypes is used for validating props.

For this application:
- Users are able to search for images by keyword using the NASA images API.
- Users are able to get the images that are returned by the API.
