# üåé React NASA image search - mock technical test

## Introduction 
A mock technical test as part of the frontend module of [Command Shift](https://www.commandshift.co/).  

I was expected to build a React web application that allows users to search for images based on a query relating to space. The application was built with React and JSX alongside Jest and React Testing library for testing purposes. Axios is used to perform http requests for retrieving data from the API and PropTypes is used for validating props.

For this application:
- Users are able to search for images by keyword using the NASA images API.
- Users are able to get the images that are returned by the API.

## Quick Start and Commands

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yan-fung/react-technical-test.git
```

2. To install the package locally:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server for the app.

```bash
npm start
```

4. To test the codes in tests folder. 

```bash
npm test
```

## Technology
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) and [React Testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) are used for testing purposes.
- [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) is used to perform HTTP requests for retrieving data from the API
- [PropTypes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types) is used for validating props.

## How To Use
Enter the name of the stars or planets in the search bar to get the images.

## Improvements & Further Development
If I would have more time, I would like to add the following features and to my application:
- Making the application more repsonsive to different sizes of device.
- Allowing users to see some basic info regarding the stars/planets alongside the images.
- Changing the UI design to make it more appealing and user-friendly.
